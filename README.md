# AI Open Network Sample Research Project

## (Title) Project X: Social media botnet detection and analysis

* Tagline: For example( Analyze political botnet activity on Twitter and develop effective counter-measures)
* Date: October 2016
* Category: Applied Research
* Contact(s): researcher @example.com

## Project Status:

* Explain where the project is at in few points:
  * Brainstorming approaches to tackle part 1/2/3.. of the problem.
  * Baseline model is built, here are results:

    | | Accuracy | Loss | Time | Data |
    |---------------------|----------|------|------|------|
    | Model Name - Author X | 2.xxx | 70 | 1hr | 20 datapoints |
    | Model Two - Author Y | 89.xxx | 3 | 2wks | 50k datapoints |

## Community Links:

* Mailing list: (By the authors ideally)
* Slack/Gitter Channel Link:

## Problem description:

Explain the goal outcome here in few sentences. Ideally this

## Why this problem matters:

This is a more in depth explanation into the problem:

* Some down falls without this research.
* Current approach into how this task is being accomplished: [manually, linear models, no have been attempted]
* Getting a little of technical teaser here wouldn't be bad perhaps, (technical in terms of the project).

Essentially, this could be a matching point for other researchers interest to be picked and join.

## Datasets:

The more data resources, the better!

Pleas include information about the nature of the data if possible:
For example:

* Company A, API: (Limit on 100 calls per minutes) Link to the API documentation
* Open Dataset: (10 Gb), Link to a paper about the dataset if possible, if not then some project that uses the dataset.

* Another suggested format by *[Megan Risdal](#kaggle)*:
  * The context: How was the data collected and why?
  * Contents: What fields are in your data? What are their units of measurement? Are there missing values or other recording flaws?
  * Goals: Do you have any objectives in mind in making your data open?
  * Acknowledgments: Who do you owe thanks for sharing this dataset? Provide details on the datasets’s provenance. This is not only important in collaborative social data science, but may also be a part of respecting the dataset owner’s license.


Examples:
  * [Iris Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) information given on the page.
  * [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation).

## Extracting Data - Preprocessing details:

If applicable, point to scripts that:
  * Fetches the data for train/test.
  * does preprocessing to the given approaches towards the project. (i.e: Tokenization, Word Embedding)

## Relevant Work:

This will be **one of the main key places** for other researchers to contribute to during the project lifetime.

* Papers that tackle either:
  * this same research goal.
  * that uses approaches to other problems outside the scope of this research, however insightful.

## Contribute:

Few things to have in here:

* Provide starting point readme and status of the current project for new researchers, since these projects can take months if not longer sometimes to complete.
* Guideline on how to edit-add new resources to this project if there is a specific requirement to meet.
* Please create a branch and do a pull-request when adding to this project.
* Open Issues if something is not clear in the readme.

**PS: Last few notes:**
* Be Nice Be Respectful.
* Value other people's work, please reference them, don't just copy paste what you find.
* Give constructive criticism, as in if you see something not working, or wrong, suggest an attempt to tackle resolving it.
* Please Ask Questions: This is one big attempt to open up opportunity for everyone being able to contribute if they can add value.
* Keep in mind that most researchers that are opening these projects might have full-time work/research, if there is a specific question try opening an issue, use given open communication channels rather than direct contact right away.
