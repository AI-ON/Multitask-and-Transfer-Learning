# AI Open Network Research Project Example


## Project Title Here (i.e: Social media botnet detection and analysis)

* Tagline: (i.e: Analyze political botnet activity on Twitter and develop effective counter-measures)
* Date: (Date the research opened, i.e: October 2016)
* Category: [Applied Research, Fundamental Research]
* Contact(s): researcher(s) @example.com

## Project Status:

* Explain what stage the project is at as of now, in few points:
  * Brainstorming Phase: disucssing approaches to tackle part 1/2/3.. of the problem.
  * Baseline model is built, here are results:

    | | Accuracy | Loss | Time | Data |
    |---------------------|----------|------|------|------|
    | Model Name - Author X | 2.xxx | 70 | 1hr | 20 datapoints |
    | Model Two - Author Y | 89.xxx | 3 | 2wks | 50k datapoints |

## Community Links:

* Mailing list: (By the authors ideally)
* Slack/Gitter Channel Links

## Problem description:

Explain the goal outcome here in few sentences.

## Why this problem matters:

This is a more in depth explanation into the problem from the previous section:

* Some downfalls without this research existing.
* Current approaches into how this task is being accomplished: [manually, ml-linear models, not have been attempted]
* Getting a little technical here wouldn't be bad perhaps, (technical in terms of the project suggested approach).

Essentially, this can be a convincing point for other researchers with common interest to join.

## Datasets:

The more data resources, the better!

Please include information about the nature of the data (if possible):
For example:

* Company A, API: (Limit on 100 calls per minute) Link to the API documentation
* Open Dataset: (10 Gb), Link to a paper about the dataset (if possible). if not, then some project that uses the dataset.

* Another suggested format by *[Megan Risdal](#kaggle)*:
  * The context: How was the data collected and why?
  * Contents: What fields are in your data? What are their units of measurement? Are there missing values or other recording flaws?
  * Goals: What are the objectives of this dataset is introduced for?
  * Acknowledgments: Who do you owe thanks for sharing this dataset? Provide details on the datasets’s provenance. This is not only important in collaborative social data science, but may also be a part of respecting the dataset owner’s license.


Examples:
  * [Iris Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) information given on the page.
  * [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation).

## Extracting Data - Preprocessing details:

If applicable, point to scripts that:
  * Fetches the data for train/test.
  * Performs preprocessing to the given approaches towards the project. (i.e: Tokenization, Word Embedding, RGB Image Reshaping)

## Relevant Work:

This will be **one of the main key places** for other researchers to contribute to during the project lifetime.

* Papers that tackle either:
  * this same research goal.
  * that uses approaches to other problems outside the scope of this research, however, insightful and relevant in building the architecture of this research's model.

## Contribute:

Few things to have in here:

* Provide a starting point readme file and status of the current project for new researchers. These projects can take months if not longer sometimes to complete, such information will help onboarding faster.
* Guideline on how to edit-add new resources to this project, if there is a specific requirement, mention them. i.e:
  - Please create a branch and do a pull-request when adding to this example project.
  - Open Issues if something is not clear in the readme, or found linguistic/ grammar mistakes.

**PS: Last few notes:**
* Be Nice & Be Respectful.
* Value other people's work, please reference them. Don't just copy & paste what you find elsewhere when it comes to sharing information.
* Give constructive criticism, as in if you see something not working, or wrong, suggest an attempt to tackle resolving the issue.
* Please Ask Questions: This is one big attempt to open up opportunity for everyone being able to contribute, if they can add value towards these research topics.
* Also, keep in mind that most of the researchers that are opening these projects might have full-time work/research. If there is a specific question, try opening an issue, use the given open communication channels rather than direct contact.
